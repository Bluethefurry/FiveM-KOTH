# Contribution Guide

We Encourage common sense, so please, use it

- use Tabs, not Spaces
- if one person writes code one way, and the other writes them another way, find a compromise, dont just go and do completely different things and then try to get it to merge, use common sense and look at existing code for usage rules
- if you have questions or proposals, JUST ASK, we wont hurt you
- use up-to-date and accepted standards ( such as RegisterCommand instead of adding an event for chatMessage, not excessively using stringsplit, etc. )
- code doesnt fit one file name? create a new one!
- please, for the love of code, discuss ideas, dont stay quiet and then complain if there is an issue
- don't be afraid to edit other people's code, they won't get hurt from it, if there is something you want to fix/improve, just do it, you dont need to ask for permissions.
